REST API
Full form of REST API is Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface more commonly known as REST API web service. 
It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer a representation of the requested resource's state to the client system.

What is the hierarchy of statement, function,class, module, package and library in python?
In Python, the terms class, function, statement, module, package, and library all represent different levels of abstraction and organization within a program. They are connected in a hierarchical manner as follows:

Statement: A statement is the smallest standalone element of a program that expresses some action to be carried out. Examples of statements include variable assignments, control flow statements (like if, for, while), and expressions.

python
Copy code
x = 10  # Assignment statement
print(x)  # Expression statement
Function: A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions can contain multiple statements and can be defined using the def keyword.

python
Copy code
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have. Classes can contain methods, which are functions defined within the class.

python
Copy code
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b
Module: A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. A module can define functions, classes, and variables. It can also include runnable code. Modules are used to organize code into manageable sections.

python
Copy code
# my_module.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b
Package: A package is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. A package contains an __init__.py file, which can be empty or contain initialization code for the package. Packages help to structure the module namespace by using "dotted module names".

markdown
Copy code
my_package/
├── __init__.py
├── module1.py
└── module2.py
Library: A library is a collection of packages and modules that provide a wide range of functionality. Libraries are often published and distributed to be reused in different programs. They can be installed using package managers like pip.

Examples of libraries include:

Standard Library: Built-in modules and packages provided by Python, like math, os, and sys.
Third-Party Libraries: External libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Requests.
Hierarchical Order
Here is the hierarchical relationship among these terms:

Statements are the building blocks of functions and methods.
Functions and methods (methods are functions within a class) contain multiple statements.
Classes encapsulate functions (methods) and data attributes.
Modules contain classes, functions, and variable definitions, and they organize them into separate files.
Packages are directories that contain multiple modules and possibly sub-packages, providing a hierarchical organization.
Libraries are collections of packages and modules, providing extensive functionality and tools.
Here's a diagram to visualize this hierarchy:

Copy code
Library
  └── Package
        └── Module
              └── Class
                    └── Method/Function
                          └── Statement
Each level in the hierarchy builds upon the previous one, creating a structured way to organize and manage code in Python.

what is beautiful soup?
Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for web scraping purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. 
It creates a parse tree for parsing HTML and XML documents, making it easy to extract and manipulate data.
Beautiful Soup -> package
Scrapy -> framework

Scrapy is an open-source and collaborative web crawling framework for Python. 
It is used to extract data from websites, process it as per requirements, and store it in your preferred format (such as CSV, JSON, or a database). 
Scrapy is highly efficient for large-scale web scraping and provides a lot of built-in functionalities for handling requests, managing web crawling, and parsing the data.
